# Visual Studio Code Customization

## üìù Why?
I am using Visual Studio code since 2018 and this time I created lots of projects with this code editor. VS Code is my favorite code editor. It's fast and flexible. no matter which operating system I am using VS code is my go-to editor. Over a long period of time, I needed lots of modifications, I changed the look, features, extensions as well as theme. No theme is perfect for my personalization, so I customized a theme in my way. Also, I like to customize extension features. So every time why I set up a new work environment I need to do it manually. So, I uploaded all settings here. So I can do this fast. You can use any one of them.
